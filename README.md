# flutter_iot_app2

Flutter app created as part of my bachelor's thesis. 

It is used in conjuction with Smart planter connected to Firebase Realtime Database using WeMos D1 board and various sensors.

This app can authorize a user (Not yet fully implemented) and after that, user can control, view and customize smart planter.

App has 3 primary screens:

Home > viewing humidity, temperature and manually turning on and off water pump.

Settings > selecting and changing minimum and max humidity, turning on automatic watering and turning on and off whole system

Graphs > viewing humidity logged every hour with a timestamp
